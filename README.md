## About the project:


_DeviceStore is an online store for selling various devices._

## Why the application was created:

_This project was created to study ASP .Net technology. Also, to study MS Sql Server. I did not use the migrations, but created the database and all the logic myself. I learned to use DI and IoC - container (Ninject)._

## Technologies:

- ASP .Net (MVC).
- MS Sql Server.
- Ninject 3.
- Bootstrap 3.

## How to start:

##### 1    
Go to the DeviceStore.WebUI / App_Data / folder, find the DeviceStore.mdf file and copy the link to it.

Go to Web.config and paste the link into <connectionString>:

```
<connectionStrings>
    <add name="AppDbContext"
         connectionString="Your way for db"
         providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
